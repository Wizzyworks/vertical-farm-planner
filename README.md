# 🌱 Vertical Farm Planner
A Pre-Investment Decision Engine for First-Time Vertical Farm Founders in India

📌 Overview

Vertical Farm Planner is a decision-support system designed to help first-time vertical farm founders in India evaluate the technical feasibility, operational costs, yield potential, and ROI before making capital-intensive investments.

Instead of guesswork, this tool simulates different infrastructure and energy configurations (Solar / Grid / Hybrid) and provides data-backed insights for smarter early-stage decisions.

⚠️ This is not a business guarantee tool.
✅ It is a pre-investment planning and simulation engine.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Vertical farming in India faces high failure rates due to:

Poor upfront cost estimation

Unrealistic yield expectations

Ignoring energy costs & hybrid setups

Lack of localized ROI modeling

No beginner-friendly planning tools

Most founders fail before the first harvest.

# 💡 Solution

Vertical Farm Planner acts as a virtual advisor that:

Simulates farming plans

Estimates yield & costs

Highlights ROI risks early

Suggests improvements before real money is spent
